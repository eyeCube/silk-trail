Caravan Trail

Time period 1325 AD

You can choose to leave on the first of the month in any month of the year 1325. The entire caravan will leave together and travel as one unit.

If you leave in the end of the year (fall / winter), it may be 1326 by the time you arrive in Kashgar / Torugart Pass, which is Chagatai Khanate territory, the relations between Yuan Dynasty and Chagatai Khanate are friendly, so you will not encounter Mongolian raiders anymore. (Typically, in Chagatai Khanate territory there are Mongolian raiders in addition to regular bandits but they stop coming in the second month of 1326.)
